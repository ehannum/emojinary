# emojinary
(name subject to change)

A simple party game for phones. Get a movie, describe or reenact it using only emoji.

Designed for same room multiplayer though technically there is a text box for guessing if you can get titles exactly right.

TODO:

 - Add a "close enough" algorithm to the guessing function to detect that "Feris Bulers Day Off" is basically the same as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"

 - Maybe add a countdown timer that starts after the first emojis are sent. For the purposes of awarding more points for quicker answers, not for ending the round when it runs out.

 - Come up with a new name. "Emojinary" is already basically everywhere. Try googling it.
