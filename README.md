# Mojies

A simple party game for phones. Get a movie, describe or reenact it using only emoji.

Designed for same room multiplayer though technically there is a text box for guessing if you can get titles exactly right.

TODO:

 - Add a "fuzzy matching" algorithm to the guessing function to detect that "feris bulers day off" is basically the same as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"

 - Maybe add a countdown timer that starts after the first emojis are sent. For the purposes of awarding more points for quicker answers, not for ending the round when it runs out.

 - Improve UI and user flow. (Allow users to leave one room and enter another, )

 - Consider migrating from socket.io to firebase. See if that solves some of the disconnection issues.

DEV INSTRUCTIONS:

1. npm install
2. grunt
3. That's about it...
